What Is Postmortem DNA Testing?



Postmortem DNA testing determines biological relationships when one individual is deceased.



While postmortem paternity testing is the most common request, testing can also determine:



• Whether a deceased man was the biological father

• Whether grandparents are biologically related to a child

• Whether siblings share a biological parent

• Whether an aunt or uncle is biologically related

• Other kinship relationships required for probate or inheritance matters



In Denver and throughout Colorado, legal admissibility depends on documented procedure, not simply DNA extraction.



If results may be used in court, the correct testing pathway must be selected from the beginning.



Call before proceeding to ensure your case is structured properly.

Legal vs Personal Effects DNA Testing



Not all postmortem DNA testing is legally admissible.



Legal Postmortem DNA Testing



Used for:



• Denver probate proceedings

• Colorado inheritance claims

• Social Security survivor benefits

• Court submission

• Birth certificate amendments



Legal testing requires:



• Government-issued identification for living participants

• Certified third-party DNA collection

• Strict chain-of-custody documentation

• AABB-accredited laboratory analysis

• Court-admissible reporting



⸻



Personal Effects DNA Testing



Used for informational purposes only.



This may involve items such as:



• Toothbrush

• Razor

• Clothing

• Hairbrush



DNA recovery from personal items depends on sample condition and environmental exposure.



Results from personal effects testing are not court admissible, and legal chain-of-custody cannot be created retroactively.



If inheritance or court use is possible, legal testing must be selected from the start.
