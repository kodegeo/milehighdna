What Is a Single Profile DNA Test?


A Single Profile DNA Test creates a laboratory-issued DNA profile for one individual only.



This test does not compare two people.

It establishes and preserves a DNA profile for future use.



If a comparison is needed later, that is ordered as a separate test.

When Is This Test Needed?


This service is commonly requested when:



• The other party is out of state or out of the country

• The other participant is unavailable or refusing to test

• You want to preserve DNA documentation before a medical procedure

• You anticipate a future legal matter but need documentation now

• You want control over timing instead of waiting



You do not have to delay action just because someone else is unavailable.
