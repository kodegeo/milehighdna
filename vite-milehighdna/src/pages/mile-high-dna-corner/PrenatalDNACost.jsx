            As you mentally and physically prepare for a little one, you might be asking a few questions. One of those questions may be, How much does a prenatal DNA test cost? 
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">It's a complicated but fair question. If this is a question for you, then this article may be able to help you in your research. The truth is, there isn't one simple price. The cost of a prenatal DNA test depends on several factors: the type of test you choose, how early in pregnancy it's performed, and the laboratory that analyzes the DNA.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">For the frontrange communities, you'll find a range of prenatal testing options — from non-invasive tests that safely analyze your baby's DNA through the mother's blood, to invasive procedures like CVS or amniocentesis, which are typically reserved for specific medical reasons.</p>
          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-blue-700 my-8">
          Non-invasive prenatal paternity testing is <strong>the most accurate and safest method</strong> of establishing paternity before a baby is born. <br /><br /> - <a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/paternity-tests/non-invasive-prenatal-paternity-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Pregnancy Association

          <p className="mb-6">For most families, the Non-Invasive Prenatal Paternity (NIPP) Test has become the preferred option. It offers accuracy, privacy, and peace of mind — all without any risk to the baby. The NIPP test works by detecting small fragments of fetal DNA, called cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA), that circulate in the mother's bloodstream. These fragments are compared with the potential father's DNA using advanced lab analysis to confirm paternity with over 99.9% accuracy.</p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-800">How Much Does a Prenatal DNA Test Cost, Near Me?</h3>
          <p className="mb-6">The typical cost for a NIPP test ranges between $1,599 and $1,799, depending on turnaround time and whether legal documentation is required. While the price can seem high, it reflects the specialized technology and strict accreditation standards behind every test. Choosing a certified lab ensures you're receiving reliable, court-admissible results and professional confidentiality throughout the process.</p>
