            Why Local Testing in Denver Still Matters
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base mb-6 text-justify">
            If you're located in Colorado, choosing a local DNA testing center
            gives you direct access to in-office or mobile collection appointments
            when needed. Our Denver office serves the metro area, including
            Aurora, Lakewood, Westminster, Thornton, and Littleton.

            What Most Store-Bought DNA Kits Don't Offer
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base mb-6 text-justify">
            Retail kits from Walgreens, CVS, or online marketplaces may seem
            simple, but they're often processed by consumer-grade labs with
            limited oversight. They typically lack professional handling, privacy
            standards, and accreditation.

            Be Cautious of Non-Professional At-Home DNA Kits
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base mb-6 text-justify">
            Many low-cost kits online are managed by unverified companies without
            accredited laboratories or transparent data policies. These kits may
            put your family's privacy at risk.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
            <li>Samples may be processed overseas or in non-regulated labs</li>
            <li>Privacy risks — some companies store or sell genetic data</li>
            <li>Inaccurate results due to lack of oversight</li>
            <li>No phone number, address, or refund policy</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-base mb-6 text-justify">
            Before purchasing any DNA kit online, always ask: Is the laboratory{" "}
            AABB accredited? Can you speak to a real person? Will
            your DNA data remain private? Choosing{" "}

            Important: At-Home Kits Are for Peace of Mind Only
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base mb-6 text-justify">
            At-home DNA kits are for personal use only and cannot be upgraded to
            legal tests because they don't meet chain-of-custody standards. For
            court, child support, or immigration purposes, schedule a legal DNA
            test in Denver with our AABB certified collector.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-800">
            Why Accreditation and Upgrades Matter
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base mb-6 text-justify">
            AABB accreditation ensures the highest scientific standards for DNA
            testing. Upgrades such as express shipping and expedited testing help
            you receive your results faster, while video call support provides
            supervised guidance from an accredited DNA collector.

          How accurate are at-home paternity DNA test kits?
        </h3>
         <p className="text-base text-gray-700">
           Professional-grade at-home DNA test kits, like those from <span className="font-semibold text-[#2C6FA6]">Mile High DNA Testing</span>, 
           provide over 99.9% accuracy when samples are collected correctly. 
           All testing is processed in AABB-accredited laboratories for 
           verified, court-level precision, even though these kits are designed for 
           peace-of-mind use.

      <div>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">
          Can I use an at-home DNA test for legal purposes?
        </h3>
        <p className="text-base text-gray-700">
          No. At-home DNA test kits are for personal or informational use only. Legal cases such as child support, custody, or immigration require a chain-of-custody DNA test performed by a certified collector under verified conditions.

      <div>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">
          How long do at-home DNA test results take?
        </h3>
         <p className="text-base text-gray-700">
           Most at-home paternity DNA test results are available within 3 to 5 business days after all samples reach the lab. <span className="font-semibold text-[#2C6FA6]">Mile High DNA Testing</span> offers express DNA shipping and expedited testing options for faster turnaround.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">
          Can participants live in different cities or states?
        </h3>
        <p className="text-base text-gray-700">
          Yes. We offer nationwide DNA testing with multi-city shipping so each participant can collect their own sample privately at home. This makes it easy for families in separate locations to complete a paternity or relationship DNA test securely.

          Is my DNA information kept private and confidential?
