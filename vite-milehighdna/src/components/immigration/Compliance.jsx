            Immigration DNA testing differs from standard legal DNA tests. All testing must be initiated through an AABB-accredited laboratory and conducted under strict USCIS and U.S. Department of State compliance requirements. Petitioner-initiated testing ensures accuracy, legitimacy, and USCIS acceptance. Every step aligns with federal immigration standards, and official results are submitted directly to the appropriate immigration authorities to maintain chain-of-custody and legal validity.
