They typically:
- Lack **professional handling** and **privacy standards**
- Are not **AABB accredited**

- **Privacy issues:** Some companies store or sell genetic data  
- **Inaccurate results:** Errors in handling or collection  
- **No customer service:** No phone number, address, or refund policy  

Before purchasing any DNA kit online, always ask:
1. Is the laboratory **AABB accredited**?  
2. Can I speak to a **real person** before or after testing?  
3. Where is the **laboratory located**?  
4. Will my **DNA data remain private**?
